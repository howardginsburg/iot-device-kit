# EspressIf ESP32-Azure IoT Kit

## Overview

The [ESP32-Azure IoT Kit](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-azure-kit/overview) is built on the ESP32 chip.  It includes motion, magnetometer, barometer, temperature and humidity, and light sensors.  This demo showcases how to use the Azure IoT Middleware for FreeRTOS capabilities.

## Deployment

Follow the [tutorial](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-middleware-freertos-samples/tree/main/demos/projects/ESPRESSIF/aziotkit) provided in Azure Samples.

## Learnings

- This is a major upgrade for developers using FreeRTOS and want to use Azure.  It greatly simplifies things.
- I like how the utilities included help ensure you're not hardcoding connection strings.
- The IDF tools included are easy to work with and customize.  A few of the menus need to be looked at carefully, but not a show stopper.
